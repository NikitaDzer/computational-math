# Math Lab 1. Approximation of the first derivative
### Task
The task is to calculate an error on step of 5 approximation methods for 5 given functions.

### Result
##### 1. f(x) = sin(x^2)
![Plot for f(x).](./assets/error1.svg)

##### 2. f(x) = cos(sin(x))
![Plot for f(x).](./assets/error2.svg)

##### 3. f(x) = exp(sin(cos(x)))
![Plot for f(x).](./assets/error3.svg)

##### 4. f(x) = ln(x+3)
![Plot for f(x).](./assets/error4.svg)

##### 5. f(x) = sqrt(x+3)
![Plot for f(x).](./assets/error5.svg)

### Conclusion
As we can see from plots, better approximation accuracy can be achieved by taking a smaller step. But this does not work in the whole range. There must be non-zero step at which maximum accuracy is achieved. Further step decreasing would lead to worse accuracy in calculations due to an error of [machine floating-point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic).
