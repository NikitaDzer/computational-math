# Math Lab 2. Direct and iterative methods for solving SLAE
### Task
The task is to get acquainted with the methods for solving SLAE. There are 2 parts of the task:
* calculate discrepancy of [Gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) and [LU-decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition) methods
* calculate discrepancy on iterations number of [Jacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method), [Seidel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method) and [Relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successive_over-relaxation) iterative methods

### Results
#### 1. Gauss and LU-decomposition methods.
For a given matrix the discrepancy of two methods is ~0.

#### 2. Iterative methods.

### Conclusion
As we can see from a plot, the discrepancy of iterative methods decreases as the number of iterations increases. In fact, this is not done for every matrix, since not all matrices satisfy the condition of [convergence of iterative methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method).
Gauss and LU-decomposition methods are direct methods for solving SLAE, so their discrepancy, as expected, is ~0.
